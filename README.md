# BlockPotPVP (former BlockCommand)
A In-house Plugin from PMnS, created by myself. Inspired from PMMP forums, that player will give PotPVP Items when stepped on a specific block, and specific world based on the config.yml

> Original Plugin BlockCommand can be found at [Lycol50's repository](https://github.com/Lycol50/BlockCommander)
