# BlockPotPVP (former BlockCommand)
A In-house Plugin from PMnS, created by myself. Inspired from PMMP forums, that player will give PotPVP Items when stepped on a specific block, and specific world based on the config.yml

## Config
```
# Enter your world name to be used for BlockCommand (Multiple worlds coming soon)
world: ""

# Enter block id to set, usually a number
block-id: 57 # diamond block
```

## Items
- Armors
    - Diamond Helmet (with Unbreaking 3, and Protection 2)
    - Diamond Chestplate (with Unbreaking 3, and Fire Protection 2)
    - Diamond Leggings (with Unbreaking 3)
    - Diamond Boots (with Unbreaking 3)
- Items (in order)
    - Diamond Sword (with Fire Aspect 2, Sharpness 3, Unbreaking 3)
    - Steak x32
    - Ender Pearl x16
    - Golden Apple x32
    - The rest is Splash potion of Instant Health
